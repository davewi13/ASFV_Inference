This is the code to carry out parameter inference on the African Swine Fever data, as described in the paper "Exact Bayesian inference of epidemiological parameters from mortality data: application to African swine fever virus".

The code is written in C++ and is currently set up to run the inference for herd 1 of the 9 presented in the paper.  Running inference for a different herd is easily achieved by changing the selection of the observed removal times at the top of the .cc file.
